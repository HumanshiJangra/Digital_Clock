# Digital_Clock
The Simple Digital Clock is a basic web-based application that displays the current time in a digital format. The project will be created using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality.
Components:

HTML:

index.html: This file will contain the basic structure of the web page.
Inside the HTML file, there will be a <div> element with an ID to display the clock's time.
CSS:

style.css: This file will be used to style the digital clock and make it visually appealing.
The clock will be centered on the page, and the font and colors can be customized to suit the design.
JavaScript:

script.js: This file will handle the logic to update the clock's time in real-time.
The JavaScript code will use the Date object to get the current time and update the clock display every second.
The time will be formatted in hours, minutes, and seconds with AM/PM indication (12-hour format).
